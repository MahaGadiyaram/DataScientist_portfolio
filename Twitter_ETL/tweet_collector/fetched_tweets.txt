J H@macantone Amen Mario‚ÄºÔ∏è It was a vicious attack on our Nation &amp; Democracy. Those people &amp; Republicans ought to be ashamed of themselves.In year 2021 Democracy around the world encounters  major problems. Some nation democracy was even overrun. Regardless I still have to say "Happy New Year everyone!"@MVM_Stroud_Dist @getprdone @electoralreform @CompassOffice @fairvote @FairVoteVA @FairVoteCanada @FairVoteNL @fairvotewrc @fairvotebc @FairVoteOntario @FairVoteIL @FairVoteAction @FairVoteMN Parliament should reflect the political diversity of a nation. Democracy doesn‚Äôt discriminate and neither should we. https://t.co/Ry9RdAlNzk@GOPLeader You not only SABOTAGED our nation, democracy and Constitution but BETRAYED GOD to idolize, adore, idolize and worship a CULT ring leader who used his NEO-NAZIS insurrectionist to vandalize, ransacked, destroy our Capitol to undermine our democracy and Constitution. https://t.co/S3G0p6ilA0@JoeBiden Well than defend it, instead of bla bla, I will, I will, I will, you have no will, you mean you want to defend this nation from yourself? Because you‚Äôre no one, you‚Äôre the enemy of this nation.

Democracy is been taken over, flags worldwide taken over.

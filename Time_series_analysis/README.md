# Project : Time Series Analysis

<h2>Project Overview :</h2>

1. In this project I created a short-term temperature forecast from Berlin-Tempelhof Temperature data

2. Get and clean temperature data from www.ecad.eu

3.Build a baseline model modelling trend and seasonality

4.Plot and inspect the different components of a time series

5.Model time dependence of the remainder using an AR model

6.Compare the statistical output of different AR models

7.Test the remainder for stationarity

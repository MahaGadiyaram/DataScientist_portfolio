(extra for pizza too)In a food processor we're going to put our basil, the cheese, soaked almonds, little salt and pepper, and 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil.Process it on and off for thirty seconds.Then drizzle in the rest of the olive oil while the food processor is on. This makes sure you get the optimal consistency for your likings.When it's made fresh the oil tends to separate from the other ingredients. I suggest serving this after it's been in the refrigerator for an hour because the pesto rests and stays together better.When the dough has doubled plop it onto a lightly dusted countertop and move it around so the entire dough gets covered.Divide it into thirds.Preheat the oven to 500F and place a baking stone on the middle rack. (you can also use an overturned cookie sheet)NOTE: The baking stone/cookie sheet has to be larger than the size of the pizza you are making, otherwise it will hang over the edges and burn onto the oven rack.Coat one ball of dough with flour and place it on a well-floured surface. Using your fingertips, gently flatten the dough into an 8-inch disk, leaving an inch or so of outer edge thicker than the center.Using your hands, gently stretch it into a 10-12 inch round, working along the edges and giving the dough quarter turns as you stretch it.Transfer the dough onto a pizza peel coated with flour or semolina, cornmeal is fine as well.Top with a thin layer of the pesto.Mandolin thin slices of potato and arrange them on the pizza. I don't prepare the potato ahead of time because sometimes it will oxidize and turn red and it makes for an ugly pizza.Slide the pizza onto the stone and bake it for 10-12 minutes or until the crust is brown and the cheese as melty and shimmering.Wait a little to slice and serve.Serve it hot.I feel obliged to remind you about the other two balls of dough, but once you devour the first one I guarantee you'll be searching for the others.

If you want the gnocchi to look super nice, roll them on a fork to give them the characteristic stripes (I never do).Place the gnocchi in the fridge while you prepare the sauce.Cut the savoy cabbage in stripes, wash it and stew it with a bit of water until wilted.Drain it and sautee it with 1 spoon butter and salt until cooked.Prepare the cheese by dicing it and the rest of the butter by melting it with the sage and the garlic.Cook the gnocchi in salted boiling water in batches. Throw 10-20 gnocchi in the pot of boiling water and fish them out once they start floating.Drain them and add them to a bowl. Dress with cheese, cabbage and butter and keep layering the ingredients in the bowl until you run out.Do not mix the gnocchi in the bowl, as they are rather soft and would break. If the cheese didn't melt much, you can microwave the bowl for a couple of minutes.Serve piping hot."

Stir occasionally, until lightly browned.Then, add the onions, carrots, celery, and potato to the pot and cook for medium heat for 8 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften. Again, stir occasionally. In the last 30 - 60 seconds, add in the garlic, dried thyme, dried basil, and red pepper flakes.Now add in the canned tomatoes, chicken broth, and a bay leaf. Give it a quick stir and season with salt and pepper. Don't season too aggressively, because the pancetta and chicken broth already have salt. You can add more later on, if necessary!Bring the soup to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, lower to medium and simmer uncovered for 10-12 minutes.Then add in the dry quinoa and cook for another 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the quinoa is cooked.Now discard the bay leaf and add in the beans, white wine, and pesto.Remove the soup from the heat and stir in the baby spinach.Re-season with salt and pepper and place back on the stove to warm it back up, if necessary!Serve immediately with an optional sprinkle of shredded parmesan cheese and a side of crusty baguette smothered in pesto!"

636360,Brussels Sprout Carbonara with Fettuccini,45,4,https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/636360-312x231.jpg,Italian,1,"{'pasta': '62.5 gr', 'brussels sprouts': '137.5 gr', 'shallots': '0.5 ', 'garlic': '0.5 large', 'bacon pieces': '37.5 gr', 'eggs': '0.5 ', 'pepper': '0.25 serving', 'parmesan cheese': '18.75 gr', 'salt': '0.25 serving', 'olive oil': '0.5 '}","['pasta', 'brussels sprouts', 'shallots', 'garlic', 'bacon pieces', 'eggs', 'pepper', 'parmesan cheese', 'salt', 'olive oil']","Heat the oil in a non-stick pan.  When it reaches a medium high heat, add the shallots and garlic and saut for a minute.Add the sprouts, cook until they are browned and become a little softer ( not too soft though, you dont want them to be mushy, but to retain a little bite).  You can probably get going with cooking the pasta when the sprouts are nearly finished.  Just follow the instructions on the packet for timings.  The best way to cook pasta is to put it into a pan with plenty of boiling water and a good helping of salt.When the sprouts are cooked, move them to the outside area of the pan and add the bacon to the centre, allowing it to cook for a couple of minutes, turning a couple of times.When the bacon is cooked, mix it through the sprouts and give a good grind of black pepper and a little salt.  Careful with salt as the bacon and the parmesan will also add a salty flavour.When the pasta is ready, bring your two pans close together on the stove.  Then, with tongs, grab the pasta and drag is swiftly into the pan with the sprouts.  By doing this you take in some of the pasta water.  This water helps bind and create your sauce.  You dont need  much, in this case probably about 2 tablespoons worth.  This dragging technique should ensure that you have enough.Turn the heat off under your sprouts and pasta.Add the egg (not directly on to the base of the pan but onto the pasta mixture) add the parmesan.  Stir through quite quickly, this will create a creamy style sauce.Check for seasoning, and serve immediately with some extra parmesan sprinkled over the top if you wish.This works well with all sorts of pasta.  The only type that doesnt work so well for a carbonara style dish is whole meal or gluten free varieties.  These pastas seem to lack the starchy constituent that gives your sauce that creamy texture.Try using pecorino cheese instead of parmesan"

Cover and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 200 C.Place the garlic on the baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes until soft.Separately mash the pumpkin, and cottage cheese.In a large bowl place the mashed pumpkin, cottage cheese, drained and chopped sundried tomatoes, mashed garlic, and mix well. Season with some salt and lots of freshly ground pepper.Divide the dough into 4 portions and roll out as thinly as humanly possible (if you have a pasta machine you need to roll out to 3mm thickness), and leave the pasta on a dish towel until it dries out a bit.Using a 3 inch crinkle edged round cutter stamp out 30 rounds of pasta, I used all the bits and bobs and rolled out again and cut up almost the entire dough.Top 15 rounds with spoonfuls of the filling and brush the edges with water and place another round of pasta on top. Press firmly around the edges to seal.Bring a large pan of water to boil, add salt, add the ravioli and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, the pasta when cooked will rise up to the surface of the water.Drain well and toss with the drained oil from the sundried tomatoes.Sprinkle with pepper and a few sprigs of fresh coriander. Nice!"

In a saucepan over medium heat add 3 Tbsp butter and all the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper. Once a good amount of the moisture is cooked out of the mushrooms and they are lightly browned add in the vegetable broth, water and chopped parsley. Simmer for 20 minutes and voila, beautifulmushroom broth.Once the broth has been cooking for 15 minutes you can go ahead and start the risotto. In a large saut pan (the rice will plump up quite a bit!) over medium low heat add 3 Tbsp butter and the oil.Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened. Season with salt and pepper. Next add in the arborio rice and toss to coat well with the mixture. Continue to stir until the rice is toasted and opaque (clear with just a speck of white in the center of the grain).At this point the fabulous broth will be ready, keep it over low heat. Using a slotted spoon add the mushrooms from the broth into the risotto and mix to combine.Add in the wine and continue stirring until the wine is all absorbed. Next, add a couple ladles of broth to the rice and continue stirring until absorbed. You will continue doing this process until the rice is completely cooked through and the risotto is creamy. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary with salt and pepper.You don't want to overcook this otherwise you'll end up with a very sticky clumpy risotto. In the end you want to see each grain on its own. You can certainly add a little more broth if you want a looser consistency then I have pictured at the top.

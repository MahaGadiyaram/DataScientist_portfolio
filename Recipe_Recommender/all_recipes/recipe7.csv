Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour.Once the dough has risen, transfer it onto the floured surface and using your fist, knock it down.

Do NOT boil.Set the mixture aside to cool till lukewarm. About 38 deg C. Check with your finger right into the mixture. If its hot, then cool some more. I should be just very mildly comfortably warm to the touch.When the mixture is lukewarm, add 2 packets of instant dry yeast (about 16g, 4.5 teaspoons).Sprinkle the yeast on the surface of the mixture. Leave it for 3 to 5 minutes. If the yeast is fresh and alive, you will see it growing and poofing up.Add 8 C of plain flour.Mix it all up together.

As brown sugar gets clumpy. I scattered the sugar on the dough with my fingers.Chop some pecan nuts to get about 2 cups worth of chopped pecans.Sprinkle the chopped pecan nuts onto the rolled dough.Roll up the dough, lengthwise. It will be a really long roll. If the dough is very wet and you are struggling to roll it, add some flour to the surfaces to help you roll.Cut into 1 inch thick rolls.Rub pans or baking dishes generously with more melted butter.Place the cinnamon rolls comfortably in each pan/dish. Do not overcrowd as they will expand alot in the pan.Pour remaining butter over the rolls. Dont be afraid!Set them aside for 1 hour. If theres wind/draft in your kitchen, cover the rolls with table cloths. The rolls will rise some more.Pop the rolls into a oven, preheated at 180 deg Celsius.Bake for 15 to 17 minutes.While the rolls are baking, make the icing. Dont get stressed about the proportions. Just mix the ingredients till you get a gooey consistency to pour over like syrup.Make a 1/4 cup of strong coffee with 1/4 cup water and one 3-in-1 coffee mix.Add 1 tablespoon of the best honey you can get your hands on.

Lastly, using a dough hook, add flour and mix until it forms a firm yet tacky dough that pulls away from the edges. Resist adding more flour…the dough should be slightly tacky.Remove dough from the mixer and knead by hand, on a lightly floured surface, for 5 minutes (yes, even if you used a stand mixer).First RisingGrease a large bowl with butter or cooking spray.Place the dough in this bowl, cover with a warm towel, and let sit in a warm spot for 1 to 1-½ hours or until it doubles in size.CinnamonRoll FillingIn a bowl, mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter until it resembles a paste.Rolling out the dough, adding filling, and cutting into shapeFor this step, I used silicone baking mats, but you can also roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a rectangle, measuring approximately 22” x 14”.Drop some of the cinnamon roll filling here and there over the rolled out dough. Then, using a rubber spatula, gently spread the filling all over the dough, keeping away from the edges by about a quarter inch.Starting at a short end (one of the 14” ends), gently but tightly roll the dough into one long roll.Using a sharp knife (I found that a serrated knife worked best), cut the roll into 12 evenly sliced pieces. Second RisingPreheat oven to 350℉.Place the cut cinnamon rolls into a parchment-lined baking dish, three rows of four. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes, or until they’ve nearly doubled in size.Baking CinnamonRollsRemove the plastic wrap and place baking pan in the oven on the middle rack.Bake for 20 – 30 minutes. My cinnamon rolls took 30 minutes to bake, but you should start checking on them after 20 minutes. All ovens are different. The cinnamon rolls will be done when the tops have just lightly browned and the dough sounds hollow when you lightly tap on it with a spoon. The rolls will rise even more while they’re baking and will most likely touch each other. This is fine and good…they’ll stay soft in the middle.Icing for CinnamonRollsWhile the rolls are baking, make the icing. Using either a stand mixer or handheld mixer, blend together cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla until smooth. When the cinnamon rolls are done baking, let them cool about 5 minutes and add icing to the tops, so it will slightly melt and ooze between the swirls. If you prefer the icing thicker on top, wait until they’ve fully cooled. "

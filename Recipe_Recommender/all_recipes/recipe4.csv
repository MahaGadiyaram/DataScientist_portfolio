Ensure the chicken are well coated.Tightly seal the bowl with cling wrap and place in the fridge. Leave to marinade for at least 4 hours. The longer, the better.In the meantime, prepare the sauce.Look for a reputable brand of satay sauce.

Before serving, warm the satay sauce in the microwave oven, covered slightly, for approximately 1.5 to 2mins.When you are ready to grill the chicken, start forming satays by piercing the chicken through the bamboo skewers. I find it alot easier to pierce the meat into the sticks when they are long strips and I pierce through in an undulating manner.  Set aside until ready to use.Preheat your oven to 200 deg Celsius at GRILL.Place your oven shelf higher and closer to the top too.Lay the satay sticks on a cooling mesh sitting over a flat baking sheet to collect drippings.Place the tray of satay under the grill. And grill for 10 to 20 mins. It really depends on how thick your chicken sticks are.Remove the tray from the oven when one side of the satay is a golden brown (not dark brown!). Turn over the satay to the other side. And continue to grill till it has a nice dark golden brown. I like it a little burnt.Serve warm with satay sauce and sliced cucumber."

This allows a quicker cooking time and works really well if you want to barbeque the meat.With the chickens back bone facing upwards, take a sturdy pair of poultry or game scissors and cut up each side of the back bone to remove it.  Then turn the chicken over, lean on the breastbone with the heal of your hand and press hard enough to break it so that the chicken is flattened.Make a couple of slashes in the thickest part of each of the legs of the chicken.  This will allow the piri piri marinade to penetrate the flesh and also aid even cooking.Place the chicken skin side up in your roasting tray (if you are roasting in the oven) or on a dish ready to go to the barbeque.Place the piri piri marinade ingredients into the food processor and blend until you get a smooth pure.Smear the piri piri mix evenly over the chicken and place in the fridge to marinate.  Leave for a hour an hour, but longer if you can, overnight is great.To cook in the oven: Pre-heat to 200C/400F/Gas 6 .Place the chicken in a roasting tray and cook for about 30 to 45 minutes.  Check after 25 to see if the juices are running clear.  If you want a more crispy finish, you can put the chicken under a hot grill for a few minutes.To cook on the barbeque: Once the flames have died down on your barbeque fire, place the chicken skin side down on the centre area and cook for about 15 minutes until nice and crispy.  Then flip the bird over for about another 10 to 15 minutes until cooked through.  The cooking times will vary depending on your barbeque, so the best way is to check by piercing the thickest part of the bird around the area where the leg joins the body with a knife, press and if the juice that comes out runs clear then the chicken is ready.  If the juices are pink or red, then you need to cook for longer.To make the rice, add the spices to the water you will cook the rice in and stir.  Cook as normal.  When ready, fork through the parsley, butter and some salt to taste.To serve, cut the bird with your poultry scissors into 4 pieces.Cut in half lengthways, then divide the 2 halves by cutting each one between the leg and wing.Serve with the lemon wedges and a little more fresh parsley leaves sprinkled over the top.Tips and VariationsThere is no need to spatchcock your chicken if it is not going on the barbeque, but it is easier, as it holds the marinade better and cooks quicker.The marinade works well with chicken pieces too (thighs, legs, wings, breasts)The chicken will blacken a little on the outside, this is how it is supposed to look.If you dont have time to let the meat marinade for an hour, just use whatever time you have.Serve with a simple green salad and some crisp, fresh Vinho Verde.I like to make extra marinade to keep in the fridge for the next time  it will keep easily for a good few weeks."

With your finger wet the outside perimeter with a touch of water and lay another wonton wrapper over top.  Be sure to press firmly and try to remove as much air as possible.  Continue until all of your filling is gone.I like to nicely cut the excess off the wrappers so that I have neat pillows but you don't have to.You'll want to start your sauce around the same time as are getting your boiling water ready.The raviolis should only take a few minutes (they will float to the top once ready)For the sauce, in a teaspoon of oil fry the shallots for about a minute or two.Pour in your chicken stock and add the sage.

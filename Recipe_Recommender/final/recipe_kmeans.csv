(extra for pizza too)In a food processor we're going to put our basil, the cheese, soaked almonds, little salt and pepper, and 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil.Process it on and off for thirty seconds.Then drizzle in the rest of the olive oil while the food processor is on. This makes sure you get the optimal consistency for your likings.When it's made fresh the oil tends to separate from the other ingredients. I suggest serving this after it's been in the refrigerator for an hour because the pesto rests and stays together better.When the dough has doubled plop it onto a lightly dusted countertop and move it around so the entire dough gets covered.Divide it into thirds.Preheat the oven to 500F and place a baking stone on the middle rack. (you can also use an overturned cookie sheet)NOTE: The baking stone/cookie sheet has to be larger than the size of the pizza you are making, otherwise it will hang over the edges and burn onto the oven rack.Coat one ball of dough with flour and place it on a well-floured surface. Using your fingertips, gently flatten the dough into an 8-inch disk, leaving an inch or so of outer edge thicker than the center.Using your hands, gently stretch it into a 10-12 inch round, working along the edges and giving the dough quarter turns as you stretch it.Transfer the dough onto a pizza peel coated with flour or semolina, cornmeal is fine as well.Top with a thin layer of the pesto.Mandolin thin slices of potato and arrange them on the pizza. I don't prepare the potato ahead of time because sometimes it will oxidize and turn red and it makes for an ugly pizza.Slide the pizza onto the stone and bake it for 10-12 minutes or until the crust is brown and the cheese as melty and shimmering.Wait a little to slice and serve.Serve it hot.I feel obliged to remind you about the other two balls of dough, but once you devour the first one I guarantee you'll be searching for the others.

When it reaches a medium high heat, add the shallots and garlic and saut for a minute.Add the sprouts, cook until they are browned and become a little softer ( not too soft though, you dont want them to be mushy, but to retain a little bite).  You can probably get going with cooking the pasta when the sprouts are nearly finished.  Just follow the instructions on the packet for timings.  The best way to cook pasta is to put it into a pan with plenty of boiling water and a good helping of salt.When the sprouts are cooked, move them to the outside area of the pan and add the bacon to the centre, allowing it to cook for a couple of minutes, turning a couple of times.When the bacon is cooked, mix it through the sprouts and give a good grind of black pepper and a little salt.  Careful with salt as the bacon and the parmesan will also add a salty flavour.When the pasta is ready, bring your two pans close together on the stove.  Then, with tongs, grab the pasta and drag is swiftly into the pan with the sprouts.  By doing this you take in some of the pasta water.  This water helps bind and create your sauce.  You dont need  much, in this case probably about 2 tablespoons worth.  This dragging technique should ensure that you have enough.Turn the heat off under your sprouts and pasta.Add the egg (not directly on to the base of the pan but onto the pasta mixture) add the parmesan.  Stir through quite quickly, this will create a creamy style sauce.Check for seasoning, and serve immediately with some extra parmesan sprinkled over the top if you wish.This works well with all sorts of pasta.

This allows a quicker cooking time and works really well if you want to barbeque the meat.With the chickens back bone facing upwards, take a sturdy pair of poultry or game scissors and cut up each side of the back bone to remove it.  Then turn the chicken over, lean on the breastbone with the heal of your hand and press hard enough to break it so that the chicken is flattened.Make a couple of slashes in the thickest part of each of the legs of the chicken.  This will allow the piri piri marinade to penetrate the flesh and also aid even cooking.Place the chicken skin side up in your roasting tray (if you are roasting in the oven) or on a dish ready to go to the barbeque.Place the piri piri marinade ingredients into the food processor and blend until you get a smooth pure.Smear the piri piri mix evenly over the chicken and place in the fridge to marinate.  Leave for a hour an hour, but longer if you can, overnight is great.To cook in the oven: Pre-heat to 200C/400F/Gas 6 .Place the chicken in a roasting tray and cook for about 30 to 45 minutes.  Check after 25 to see if the juices are running clear.  If you want a more crispy finish, you can put the chicken under a hot grill for a few minutes.To cook on the barbeque: Once the flames have died down on your barbeque fire, place the chicken skin side down on the centre area and cook for about 15 minutes until nice and crispy.  Then flip the bird over for about another 10 to 15 minutes until cooked through.  The cooking times will vary depending on your barbeque, so the best way is to check by piercing the thickest part of the bird around the area where the leg joins the body with a knife, press and if the juice that comes out runs clear then the chicken is ready.  If the juices are pink or red, then you need to cook for longer.To make the rice, add the spices to the water you will cook the rice in and stir.  Cook as normal.  When ready, fork through the parsley, butter and some salt to taste.To serve, cut the bird with your poultry scissors into 4 pieces.Cut in half lengthways, then divide the 2 halves by cutting each one between the leg and wing.Serve with the lemon wedges and a little more fresh parsley leaves sprinkled over the top.Tips and VariationsThere is no need to spatchcock your chicken if it is not going on the barbeque, but it is easier, as it holds the marinade better and cooks quicker.The marinade works well with chicken pieces too (thighs, legs, wings, breasts)The chicken will blacken a little on the outside, this is how it is supposed to look.If you dont have time to let the meat marinade for an hour, just use whatever time you have.Serve with a simple green salad and some crisp, fresh Vinho Verde.I like to make extra marinade to keep in the fridge for the next time  it will keep easily for a good few weeks.",45,4,Chicken Piri Piri with Spicy Rice,67.12,776.66,34.38,46.83,chicken lemon korean marinade garlic onion wine lemon rice ra el hanout butter,9

Stir fry well to combine.Add the lemon grass, lime leaves and curry leaves. Stir well to combine.Add 1 tablespoon of tamarind paste. Stir well to combine and dissolve the tamarind.When the curry paste is nice and fragrant, about 1 to 2 mins later, add 3 tablespoons of Shaoxing Huatiao wine.Add 400ml of coconut cream. Every brand of coconut cream is different. Some are thicker than others. But dont add water at this point. And dont use coconut milk instead of cream or light coconut milk. Its not the same.Add 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce.Add 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir well to combine and leave to simmer on a low heat. The sauce will get very thick. Dont add water here because when the fish is placed in to cook, it will introduce alot of moisture to the sauce.When the sauce has been simmering gently for 2 to 3 mins, taste the sauce. Adjust the taste here because every brand of oyster sauce/tamarind/wine is different and the sauce needs to be fine tuned accordingly. If its too sour, add a little more sugar. If it tastes flat, add a little wine and oyster sauce. Stir well to combine.When the sauce is ready, gently add the fish into the pan. Keep the stove at medium heat and let the fish cook slowly in the sauce. Try not to handle the fish too much in the sauce as it will cause the fish to flake or break up.As the fish cooks, it will release moisture into the sauce and thin it out. Gently cover the fish with the sauce. Cover the pan and let it simmer till the fish is cooked through. It usually takes about 5 to 8 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish.When the fish is cooked, add the red capsicum strips and gently stir through till they are warmed through but not cooked till soft.

In the Punjab this one which you can try making yourself is common: 5 tbsps coriander seeds, 3 tbsps cumin seeds, 2 1/2 tbsps black peppercorns, 2 1/2 black cardamom seeds, 2 in cinnamon stick, 4-5 cloves, 1/6 nutmeg.Put the coriander and the cumin into a cast-iron frying-pan over a medium heat.Stir until lightly roasted. Allow to cool. Grind with the remaining ingredients in a clean coffee grinder and store in a tightly lidded jar.This rich flavoursome dish originates in the fertile Punjab, a state now divided between India and Pakistan. There is nothing more important to a Punjabi man's diet than bread, and meals are accompanied by flat round cornbread rotis or rich, flaky pan-fried paratha layered with ghee(clarified butter).Rice is reserved for special occasions or for rice pudding, for the only food that makes a Punjabi feel he has eaten a proper meal is his bread!

I really prefer to add all the melted butter at this stage because the flavour goes right into the dough.Using fingers, evenly distribute the butter.Sprinkle 1/4 cup of cinnamon over the dough.Sprinkle 1 cup of castor sugar over the dough.Sprinkle 1 cup of brown sugar over the dough. As brown sugar gets clumpy. I scattered the sugar on the dough with my fingers.Chop some pecan nuts to get about 2 cups worth of chopped pecans.Sprinkle the chopped pecan nuts onto the rolled dough.Roll up the dough, lengthwise. It will be a really long roll. If the dough is very wet and you are struggling to roll it, add some flour to the surfaces to help you roll.Cut into 1 inch thick rolls.Rub pans or baking dishes generously with more melted butter.Place the cinnamon rolls comfortably in each pan/dish. Do not overcrowd as they will expand alot in the pan.Pour remaining butter over the rolls. Dont be afraid!Set them aside for 1 hour. If theres wind/draft in your kitchen, cover the rolls with table cloths. The rolls will rise some more.Pop the rolls into a oven, preheated at 180 deg Celsius.Bake for 15 to 17 minutes.While the rolls are baking, make the icing. Dont get stressed about the proportions. Just mix the ingredients till you get a gooey consistency to pour over like syrup.Make a 1/4 cup of strong coffee with 1/4 cup water and one 3-in-1 coffee mix.Add 1 tablespoon of the best honey you can get your hands on. Maple syrup works too.Stir the honey into the coffee.Add a pinch of salt.Add 6 tablespoons of melted butter.Add 2 cups of icing sugar.Whisk it all up.Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of fresh cream.Stir in the cream.Pour the icing over the rolls while they are still hot.",45,25,Cinnamon Rolls by Bing,74.51,609.24,32.75,7.26,milk vegetable sugar yeast flour butter sugar pecan strong coffee icing sugar cream,3

Lastly, using a dough hook, add flour and mix until it forms a firm yet tacky dough that pulls away from the edges. Resist adding more flour…the dough should be slightly tacky.Remove dough from the mixer and knead by hand, on a lightly floured surface, for 5 minutes (yes, even if you used a stand mixer).First RisingGrease a large bowl with butter or cooking spray.Place the dough in this bowl, cover with a warm towel, and let sit in a warm spot for 1 to 1-½ hours or until it doubles in size.CinnamonRoll FillingIn a bowl, mix together brown sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter until it resembles a paste.Rolling out the dough, adding filling, and cutting into shapeFor this step, I used silicone baking mats, but you can also roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a rectangle, measuring approximately 22” x 14”.Drop some of the cinnamon roll filling here and there over the rolled out dough. Then, using a rubber spatula, gently spread the filling all over the dough, keeping away from the edges by about a quarter inch.Starting at a short end (one of the 14” ends), gently but tightly roll the dough into one long roll.Using a sharp knife (I found that a serrated knife worked best), cut the roll into 12 evenly sliced pieces. Second RisingPreheat oven to 350℉.Place the cut cinnamon rolls into a parchment-lined baking dish, three rows of four. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and let the rolls rise for another 30 minutes, or until they’ve nearly doubled in size.Baking CinnamonRollsRemove the plastic wrap and place baking pan in the oven on the middle rack.Bake for 20 – 30 minutes. My cinnamon rolls took 30 minutes to bake, but you should start checking on them after 20 minutes. All ovens are different. The cinnamon rolls will be done when the tops have just lightly browned and the dough sounds hollow when you lightly tap on it with a spoon. The rolls will rise even more while they’re baking and will most likely touch each other. This is fine and good…they’ll stay soft in the middle.Icing for CinnamonRollsWhile the rolls are baking, make the icing. Using either a stand mixer or handheld mixer, blend together cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla until smooth. When the cinnamon rolls are done baking, let them cool about 5 minutes and add icing to the tops, so it will slightly melt and ooze between the swirls. If you prefer the icing thicker on top, wait until they’ve fully cooled. ",135,12,Homemade Cinnamon Rolls,71.64,521.18,23.42,7.41,milk yeast sugar egg butter flour sugar cream cheese powdered sugar,3

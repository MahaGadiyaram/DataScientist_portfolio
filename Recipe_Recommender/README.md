Overview:

This Project is a Recipe Recommender which takes a list of ingredeints as user input and suggests recipes. 
In this project I have taken data from an API called Spoonacular api . Data from the API was in JSON format, I have extracted the recipe information like recipe ID,recipe name, ingredients, instructions, nutritional values by flatenning the JSON file. I have used Pandas and Scikit Learn to extract and clean the data , later used Seabor and Matplotlib to Visualize the data. I took the ingredients data ,parsed them and applied TFIDF . I reduced the dimensionality of the TFIDF matrix by applying PDA and later used Elbow Method to determine the number of Clusers. The Elbow Method was not clear so I guessed the number of Clusters randomly and applied KMeans Clustering model to get the Clusters. I plotted it with Plotly. Now I determined the the most frequent words occuring in each Cluster and tried to label the Clusters. Now I defined a Recommendation function which takes ingredeints lists, type of dish(Breakfast,Lunch) and time a user wants to spend cooking it as input and Suggests Top 3 Recipes.
Later I used Streamlit to present my Recipe Recommender.

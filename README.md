  [Project1: Recipe Recommender based on KMeans Clustering](https://github.com/MahaGadiyaram/DataScientist_portfolio/tree/main/Recipe_Recommender)
  1. Built a Recipe Recommender app on Streamlit based on KMeans Clustering Model
  2. Scrapped over 700 recipes from Spoonacular API by making API calls
  3. Flattended the JSON file,extracted the data ,cleaned it and feature engineered it.
  4. Parsed the ingredients data,applied TFIDF on it and applied KMeans Clustering Model on it to make Clustering of the Recipes
  5. Defined a recommendation function which takes ingredients, time of cooking,dishtype(Breakfast,Maindish) as input and recommends Recipes
  6. Finally presented the project using Streamlit app
